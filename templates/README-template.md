# Title of the sample

<!--
This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Avoid using terms like `SharePoint` and `web part` -- because that's what all the samples in this repo is all about. Also, don't use `React`, `Angular`, `JavaScript`, etc. in your sample title -- unless that's what the sample is about.
GOOD 👍:
  Kitten Videos
BAD 👎:
  react-kittenvideos
  SPFx Kitten Videos Web Part for SharePoint using React

NOTE:
It is "web part", not "webpart" -- unless when used in a class
"OneDrive", not "OneDrive"
"SharePoint" not "Sharepoint"
"PowerShell" not "Powershell"
"JavaScript" not "Javascript"

## Summary

Short summary on functionality and used technologies.

<!--
Please provide a high-quality screenshot of your web parts below. It should be stored in a folder called `assets`. 

If possible, use a resolution of 1920x1080.

If your web part uses a placeholder screen and requires the user to configure it, please use a screenshot of the web part as it appears **after** it has been configured.

You can add as many screen shots as you'd like to help users understand your web part without having to download it and install it.

## Compatibility

| :warning: Important          |
|:---------------------------|
| Every SPFx version is optimally compatible with specific versions of Node.js. In order to be able to build this sample, you need to ensure that the version of Node on your workstation matches one of the versions listed in this section. This sample will not work on a different version of Node.|
|Refer to <https://aka.ms/spfx-matrix> for more information on SPFx compatibility.   |

This sample is optimally compatible with the following environment configuration:

![SPFx 1.16.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.16.1-green.svg)
![Node.js v16 | v14 | v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v16%20%7C%20v14%20%7C%20v12-green.svg)

![Does not work with SharePoint 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/SharePoint%20Server%202019-Incompatible-red.svg "SharePoint Server 2019 requires SPFx 1.4.1 or lower")
![Does not work with SharePoint 2016 (Feature Pack 2)](https://img.shields.io/badge/SharePoint%20Server%202016%20(Feature%20Pack%202)-Incompatible-red.svg "SharePoint Server 2016 Feature Pack 2 requires SPFx 1.1")
![Local Workbench Unsupported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local%20Workbench-Unsupported-red.svg "Local workbench is no longer available as of SPFx 1.13 and above")
![Hosted Workbench Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hosted%20Workbench-Compatible-green.svg)
![Compatible with Remote Containers](https://img.shields.io/badge/Remote%20Containers-Compatible-green.svg)

<!--

If using SPFX 1.14, update the SPFx and Node.js tags as per below:
![SPFx 1.14](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.14-green.svg)
![Node.js v14 | v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v14%20%7C%20v12-green.svg)

  If using SPFx 1.13.1, update the SPFx and Node.js tags accordingly:
![SPFx 1.13.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.13.1-green.svg)

  If using SPFx 1.12.1, update the SPFx and Node.js tags accordingly:
![SPFx 1.12.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.12.1-green.svg)
![Node.js v14 | v12 | v10](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v14%20%7C%20v12%20%7C%20v10-green.svg) 

  If using an older version of SPFx, update the SPFx and Node.js compatibility tag accordingly:

  SPFx 1.11
![SPFx 1.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.11.0-green.svg) 
![Node.js v10](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v10-green.svg) 

 SPFx 1.10

 SPFx 1.4.1
![SPFx 1.4.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPFx-1.4.1-green.svg)
![Node.js v6 | v8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-LTS%206.x%20%7C%20v8-green.svg)

  If you built this sample specifically for SharePoint 2016, or SharePoint 2019 support, update the SharePoint compatibility tag accordingly:
![Works with SharePoint 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/SharePoint%20Server%202019-Compatible-green.svg)
![Work with SharePoint 2016 (Feature Pack 2)](https://img.shields.io/badge/SharePoint%20Server%202016%20(Feature%20Pack%202)-Compatible-green.svg)

  If you know your web part only works on the hosted workbench, you can use this for the workbench compatibility tag:
![Local Workbench Incompatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local%20Workbench-Incompatible-red.svg "EXPLAIN WHY IT WORK WORK IN LOCAL WORKBENCH")

  Otherwise:
![Local Workbench Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local%20Workbench-Compatible-green.svg)

  If your web part needs permissions before working in the hosted workbench, let people know;
![Hosted Workbench (Requires permissions))](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hosted%20Workbench-(Requires%20permissions%)-yellow.svg "Requires permissions to be granted before this solution can work on the hosted workbench")

  or:
![Hosted Workbench Partially)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hosted%20Workbench-Partially-yellow.svg "EXPLAIN WHY THE SOLUTION DOESN'T FULL WORK IN THE HOSTED WORKBENCH")

  Otherwise:
![Hosted Workbench Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hosted%20Workbench-Compatible-green.svg)

 If you specifically built and tested this web part to work with Teams, use this for the Teams compatibility tag:
    ![Teams Yes: Designed for Microsoft Teams](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teams-Yes-green.svg "Designed for Microsoft Teams")
 And if you know for sure that it is NOT compatible with Teams, use this:
    ![Teams No: Not designed for Microsoft Teams](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teams-No-red.svg "Not designed for Microsoft Teams")

Don't worry if you're unsure about the compatibility matrix above. We'll verify it when we approve the PR.

## Prerequisites

<!--
Any special pre-requisites? Include any lists, permissions, offerings to the demo gods, or whatever else needs to be done for this web part to work.

Please describe the steps to configure the pre-requisites. Feel free to add screen shots, but make sure that there is a text description of the steps to perform.

## Minimal path to awesome

<!-- 
PRO TIP:

For commands, use the `code syntax`

For button labels, page names, dialog names, etc. as they appear on the screen, use **Bold**

Don't use "click", use "select" or "use"

As tempting as it may be, don't just use images to describe the steps. Let's be as inclusive as possible and think about accessibility.
