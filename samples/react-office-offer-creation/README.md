## Minimal Path to Awesome

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/react-office-offer-creation) then unzip it)
* From your command line, change your current directory to the directory containing this sample (`react-office-offer-creation`, located under `samples`)
* Create the content-type for your offers in a site / default document library of your choice
  * With PnP-PowerShell for instance call the deploy script with your site URL as parameter

    ```bash
    .\templates\deploy.ps1 -siteUrl <YourFullSiteUrl>
    ```

    > This should put the same site URL to your tenant-property named 'CreateOfferSiteUrl'

* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`
* Now you can run the web part inside SharePoint.
* To use it as a Teams, Outlook, Microsoft 365 App as well:
  * Bundle and Package the solution:
    * `gulp bundle --ship`
    * `gulp package-solution --ship`
  * Upload the solution to your tenant's app catalog and "install" it tenant-wide
  * Package the icons and your manifest from the solution's \teams folder in a ZIP
  * Upload this ZIP as a custom solution or to your org's Teams' app catalog
