## Features

This sample illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* Get termset, terms and their custom properties using Microsoft Graph API (beta).
* React Hooks
* Using async / await for the async calls
* Caching the data in session storage
* Usage of PnP SPFx controls (Maps and Placeholder)
* Office UI fabric components

### Enhancements

* Currently, this web part supports 2-level cascading. So there is scope to enhance this such that it supports more levels of cascading dynamically.
