## Compatibility

| :warning: Important          |
|:---------------------------|
| Every SPFx version is only compatible with specific version(s) of Node.js. In order to be able to build this sample, please ensure that the version of Node on your workstation matches one of the versions listed in this section. This sample will not work on a different version of Node.|

## Minimal Path to Awesome

* Clone this repository
* Set the `version` node in the `package.json` file, or by using `npm version major`, `npm version minor` or `npm version patch`
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`

>  This sample can also be opened with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Visit https://aka.ms/spfx-devcontainer for more information.

## Features

The sample uses a custom `gulp` task to synchronize the `version` node from the NodeJS `package.json` to the SharePoint solution's `package-solution.json`.

The solution demonstrates how to import the `package-solution.json` into a web part using a static `import` and a `require` statement.

### Using npm version to set the version

To change the `package.json` version (which will also change your SharePoint solution version), use [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version), using one of the following parameters:

```cmd
npm version major
npm version minor
npm version patch
```

The following table shows when you should call which `npm version` command, depending on the types of changes you're making to your solution:

|Type of change|Stage|Versioning rule|Example version| NPM command
|---|---|---|---|---|
|First release|New solution|Start with 1.0.0|1.0.0| `npm version major`
|Backward compatible bug fixes|Patch release|Increment the third digit|1.0.1| `npm version patch`
|Backward compatible new features|Minor release|Increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero|1.1.0| `npm version minor`
|Changes that break backward compatibility|Major release|Increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero|2.0.0| `npm version major`

### To use the custom gulp task in your solutions

> NOTE: if you use the [PnP SPFx Yeoman generator](https://pnp.github.io/generator-spfx/), there is already a built-in `gulp` command that will synchronize your version number when you use `npm version`. You only need to follow the steps below if you use the regular SPFx Yeoman generator.

If you'd like to use the custom `gulp` task in your solutions, copy the code from this solution's `gulpfile.js` between:

```typescript
// BEGIN: Add custom version sync task
```

and

```typescript
// END: Add custom version sync task
```

To your own `gulpfile.js`.

### To use the version using the web part's manifest

The `BaseClientSideWebPart` class `context` property provides a `manifest` which contains a `version` property. To use it in your web part, simply use:

```typescript
this.context.manifest.version
```

This approach provides a version number that follows the `1.0.0` format, instead of the usual `1.0.0.0` format. However, since the `gulp` tasks describe above append an additional `.0` to the end of the `package.json` version number, you can choose to append `.0` yourself when displaying the manifest version. For example:

```typescript
this.context.manifest.version + '.0'
```

### To use the version using a static import

1. Copy the content of this solution's `src\typings.d.ts` to your own `src` folder in your own project.
2. In the code where you want to insert the solution version, add the following `import` statement:
```typescript
import * as packageSolution from '../../../config/package-solution.json';
```

Keep in mind that you may have to adjust the path to your `package-solution.json` depending on where you're adding the code within your solution.

### To use the version using a require

In the code where you want to insert the solution version, add the following `require` statement:
```typescript
const packageSolution: any = require("../../../config/package-solution.json");
```

Keep in mind that you may have to adjust the path to your `package-solution.json` depending on where you're adding the code within your solution.
