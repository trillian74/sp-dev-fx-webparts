## Summary

This sample shows a web part to show the first few sentences of an article in a SharePoint site, so that the article can be looked at a glance.

The idea is based of the *At a glance* section of a news in the BBC news app (beta).

### Highlights
- Usage of `SPHttpClient` or `PnPjs`
- Conditional property enabling
- Usage of regex to get the sentences from article content
- Usage of Carousel for mobile view
- Usage of the width property to control web part views (small or learge)
