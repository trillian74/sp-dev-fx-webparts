## Summary

This web part is using the beta MS Graph Profile endpoint to list user's profile awards. At the time of writing this sample (May 2022), this is a Beta endpoint, so it could change in the future. You can select the user you want to get their profile awards. It allows to configure different options. You can the user selecting it from a People picker, or from a Page environment variable (using Dynamic field), or just selecting the current logged user. It also allows two different layout options, so it can render the awards using cards, or in a list format.

A future version of this web part could include the ability to add new awards to your profile.

In the meantime, you can add a new award using this request: [https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/profile-post-awards?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/profile-post-awards?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http) (You can use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) tool to do so.)

__Note__: when adding a new award, ensure you set the field __allowedAudiences__ to a proper value (organization / everyone). Otherwise, the award is only visible for the user who owns it.
