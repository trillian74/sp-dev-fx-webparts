# Using PnPJS with Microsoft Graph

## Summary
This web part demonstrates how to use [PnPJS](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/) with SharePoint Framework and how to query [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/overview) with PnPJS.
It requests a list of Azure AD [groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/group-list?view=graph-rest-1.0) at your tenant and shows them using [Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/components) list.

## Minimal Path to Awesome
- clone this repo
- navigate to the folder with current sample
- restore dependencies: `$ npm i`
- bundle solution: `$ gulp bundle --ship`
- package solution: `$ gulp package-solution --ship`
- locate solution at `./sharepoint/solution/pn-p-graph-web-part.sppkg` and upload it to your tenant app catalog
- you will see a message saying that solution has pending permissions which need to be approved:  
![Pending permission requests](./assets/approve.png)
- you should approve permission requests from your SharePoint Framework web part. There are [different options available](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aadhttpclient#manage-permission-requests) - new SharePoint Admin UI, PowerShell, [`$o365`](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/) cli. For the matter of this sample, the fastest way to do it is through new SharePoint Admin UI. Open Web API permission management page by navigating to the url `https://<org>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/webApiPermissionManagement` (changing `<org>` to your real organization name) or by going to the new Admin UI directly from old SharePoint Admin Center. Select Pending `Group.Read.All` request and approve it:
![Approve request from new Admin UI](./assets/approve-request.png)
- run `$ gulp serve` and open hosted workbench, i.e. `https://<org>.sharepoint.com/sites/<your site>/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`
- add `PnPGraph` web part to see it in action

>  This sample can also be opened with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Visit https://aka.ms/spfx-devcontainer for further instructions.
