      * `npm install`
      * `gulp build --ship`
      * `gulp bundle --ship`
      * `gulp package-solution --ship`

* If you have the APIs permissions already allowed you can follow the below steps.
    * in the command line run:
        * `npm install`
        * `gulp serve --nobrowser`
    * browse to your hosted workbench and add the web part.
