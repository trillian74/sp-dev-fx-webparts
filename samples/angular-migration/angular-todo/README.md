## Minimal Path to Awesome

- create **Todo** list
  - in SharePoint site create a new list called `Todo`
  - in the `Todo` list add a new choice column called `Status`
    - as available choices enter (each value in new line): `Not started`, `In progress`, `Completed`
- configure application
  - in the `./app/app.config.js` file in the `sharepointApi` constant, update the URL of the site to match the server-relative URL of your site
- upload application
  - in SharePoint site open the **Shared Documents** library and create new folder called `Todo`
  - upload all application files and folders to the newly created `Todo` folder
- in the web browser navigate to the `index.aspx` page   

## Features

This sample application illustrates the following concepts in Angular:

- building Angular applications in plain JavaScript
- styling Angular applications using ngOfficeUIFabric
- communicating with the SharePoint REST API in Angular applications
- using application constants for storing configuration values and using them across the application
