This control supports promises and chaining for cascading drop-downs where value from one field determines values in other drop-down fields.

### Drop-down with external data without using a custom control

Cascading drop-downs in the property pane both using external data.

### Asynchronous drop-down

By default the control uses mock data. If you want to test the control with SharePoint, change the commented sections in the `DropdownWithRemoteDataWebPart.ts` file inside the `loadLists` and `loadItems` functions and deploy the sample web part to your SharePoint developer tenant.

### Drop-down with external data without using a custom control

By default the web part uses mock data. If you want to test it with SharePoint, change the commented sections in the `DropdownWithRemoteDataWithoutCustomControlsWebPart.ts` file inside the `loadLists` and `loadItems` methods and deploy the sample web part to your SharePoint tenant.

## Features

Sample web parts in this solution illustrate the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

- using React for building custom property pane controls for use with SharePoint Framework client-side web parts
- building custom property pane controls using TypeScript
- updating web part properties from custom property pane controls
- linking multiple custom property pane controls together
- loading data for use in custom property pane controls asynchronously without blocking the web part
- forcing React components to repaint using an external trigger
- displaying a custom loading indicator
- reacting to web part property changes
- updating properties of web part property pane controls
- refreshing the web part property pane from the web part
