## Minimal Path to Awesome

- clone this repo

### Deploy custom Web API

- in the Azure Management Portal at https://portal.azure.com create a new API App
  - in the settings enable CORS for all origins using an `*`
  - copy the URL of the API App
- in your SharePoint site
  - create a new list called **Tasks**
  - navigate to https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx
    - generate client ID and copy it
    - generate client secret and copy it
    - as the name use: **SPFx sample elevated privileges**
    - as the URL use the URL of the Azure API App created previously
    - as the domain use the host name of the Azure API App
  - navigate to https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx
    - lookup the newly registered Add-in using the client ID you copied
    - in the **Permissions** field past the following code:

```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
  <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection/web/list" Right="Write" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```

- after confirming the changes, when prompted, select the previously created **Tasks** list 
- from the **api** folder, in Visual Studio open the **pnp.api.elevatedprivileges.sln** file
- in the web.config file
  - update the value of the **clientId** setting with the previously copied client ID
  - update the value of the **clientSecret** setting with the previously copied client secret
  - update hte value of the **siteUrl** setting with the URL of your SharePoint site
  - if you named your list other than **Tasks** update the value of the **listName** property with the name of your list
- build the solution
- deploy the **pnp.api.elevatedprivileges** project to the newly created API App
- verify that you can access the API by navigating in your web browser to **https://your-api-app.azurewebsites.net/api/items**
  - you should get an error that GET is not a supported method

### Configure web part

- in the command line
  - change the working directory to the **webpart** folder
  - run `npm i`
- in your code editor open the **webpart** folder
- in the **./src/webparts/createTask/components/CreateTask.tsx** file
  - in line 76 replace the URL with the URL of your API App
- in the command line execute `gulp serve`
- add the web part to SharePoint workbench
- enter the name of the new item and click the **Create** button
  - verify that a new item with the name you specified has been created in the Tasks list

## Features

This project contains sample Web API using app-only permissions to create items in a specific SharePoint list, and a client-side web part connected to that API.

This project illustrates the following concepts:
- elevating user privileges for communicating with SharePoint through a custom Web API
- connecting SharePoint Framework client-side web part to a custom Web API hosted in Azure
- persisting state in React components
- communicating state updates in React components to users
- executing REST API web requests from React components
- using Office UI Fabric React components in SharePoint Framework client-side web parts
- using form controls in Rest components
