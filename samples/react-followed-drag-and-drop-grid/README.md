# Followed Drag and Drop Grid

## Summary

![image](./assets/sorting.gif)

This web part is a good example (starting point) for a solution to implement alternative view for user followed sites (or any kind of links). The web part uses Microsoft Graph so it presents how to define needed web api permissions in package-solution and use MS Graph API endpoints.

Another cool feature is also done using MS Graph in order to save or update the order of the links as a `.json` file in special approot folder which is kept on each individual user OneDrive. Thanks to that the web part may keep the user order of the links in one place where it may be easily used in a SharePoint page or in Teams.
