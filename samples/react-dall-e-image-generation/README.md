# Image generation using DALL-E API

## Summary

This web part allows you to generate some images using the recently released API of [DALL-E image generation](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/). Once the image is generated, the web part allows you to save it to the Documents library of the current site collection.

__Note__: The Images API is in beta. During this time the API and models will evolve based on your feedback. To ensure all users can prototype comfortably, the default rate limit is 10 images per minute, 25 per 5 minutes.
In this sample, we are calling the API asking for Base64 images format, while the default is a URL. We are using the Base64 format, because DALL-E servers do not support CORS, so we cannot fetch the image content to save it to SharePoint. To achieve this feature, we use the Base64 format.
