# @pnp/js and ReactJS Functional Components

## Summary

This solution builds off of the solution [react-async-await-sp-pnp-js](./react-async-await-sp-pnp-js) submitted by Jose Quinto ([@jquintozamora](https://twitter.com/jquintozamora) , [blog.josequinto.com](https://blog.josequinto.com)) and re-work of the existing class based [react-pnp-js-sample](./react-pnp-js-sample) by [Julie Turner](https://twitter.com/jfj1997)

This implementation refactors to take aspects out and utilize and showcase PnPjs Version 3 using React Functional Components and Hooks.
