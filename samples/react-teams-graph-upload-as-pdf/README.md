# Teams Graph Upload as PDF

## Summary
This SPFx web part (or Teams Tab) enables a user to upload a supported file type via drag and drop while the uploaded file will be converted as PDF.
In SharePoint context it uploads to the default drive (library) while in Teams context it uses the current channel as a Folder name in the default drive.
It uses the following capabilities (mostly) on behalf of Microsoft Graph:
* Use HTML5 drag and drop event handling
* Writing normal files smaller 4MB
* Retrieving files with format=pdf conversion

## Features

This web part illustrates the following concepts:

- Use HTML5 drag and drop event handling
- [Writing normal files smaller 4MB](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/driveitem-put-content?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
- Retrieving files with [format=pdf](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/driveitem-get-content-format?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) conversion
- [FluentUI Progress Indicator](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/progressindicator)

## Alternative
When looking for a robust solution in Microsoft Teams espacially also consider my alternative sample created with the yeoman generator for Teams.
There the up- and download functionality takes place in the backend and not via the frontend (browser).
Of course consider the same code to be combined with a SPFx forntend (only).
