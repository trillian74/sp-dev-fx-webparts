## Features

This project can be used as a starting point for any visualization of SharePoint Data. Currently it's using GoJS as dependency for the ER Diagram (in productive environment you would need to get a license for it). The data layer is abstract so it's possible to use a different library (like three.js) as presentation layer.

* the Data gets cached, to see changes made to the lists/lookups a "refresh" is needed
* alerts/warnings for the lists are displayed as well (Versioning/ItemCount/Threshholdlimit/..)
* easy opt/in/out of alerts and fields
* easy switch between Internal-/DisplayName
* Download current canvas as image
