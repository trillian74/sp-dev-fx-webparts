# Graph auto batching

## Summary

This same shows how to abstract batching graph requests. The idea behind this sample is quite simple. To render simple user card we need three calls to MS GraphAPI.
First one to get user information, second to get the image and third to get the presence. As with rendering multiple user card we may hit graph throttling, 
it is a good idea to batch those requests. This might create quite a repetition across our solution.
To avoid such situation, we can implement composition pattern to abstract that batch generation. This design pattern will also help us with unit testing.

This is the second idea behind this sample. It provides few unit tests of quite a complex implementation detail, which auto batching is.
You can also find how one can test react component in SPFx stack in isolation, by providing mock to all data access layer implementation.

Finally, let me know if You would like to see this auto batcher in some library You can import to Your solution.

You may ask why I used AadHttpClient instead of MSGraphClient. AadHttpClient shares more similarity with a http client based on fetch api, this means it will be easier to adopt this solution to an implementation outside of SPFx. 


## Compatibility

| :warning: Important          |
|:---------------------------|
| Every SPFx version is only compatible with specific version(s) of Node.js. In order to be able to build this sample, please ensure that the version of Node on your workstation matches one of the versions listed in this section. This sample will not work on a different version of Node.|
|Refer to <https://aka.ms/spfx-matrix> for more information on SPFx compatibility.   |
