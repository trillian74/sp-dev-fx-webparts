# Zod

## Summary

This sample shows the usage of [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to eliminate manual cast and validation of the data coming from external API (e.g. SharePoint REST API, Graph API, etc.).

I have a `Form Results` list that has these columns:

Column|Type
-------|----
Title|Single line of text
Description|Multiple lines of text
Qty|Number (> 0)
Rating|Number (1 - 10)
Email|Single line of text
Status|Choice
PublishDate|Date
Contact|Person

When we get list items data from SharePoint REST API. It would be better to have fully typed data to eliminate runtime error and also make it easier to process the data in TypeScript.

So I used [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to automatically cast and validate type of the data.

Below is example on how to setup the schema for my data above ([Model.ts](/src/webparts/reactZod/utils/Models.ts)):
![Schema](assets/schema.png)

We can also generate TypeScript [Type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) from the schema (See `FormResultModel` and `FormResultsModel`).

Below is how to cast and validate data based on the schema ([SharePointHelper.ts](/src/webparts/reactZod/utils/SharePointHelper.ts)):
![Parse Data](assets/parse-data.png)

That line of code will do the following:
- Cast
  - `Id` as number
  - `Title` as string
  - `Description` as string
  - `IsActive` as boolean
  - `Qty` as number
  - `Rating` as number
  - `Email` as string
  - `Status` as string
  - `PublishDate` as string
  - `Contact` as object
- Validate
  - `Qty` should be non negative
  - `Rating` should be between 1 - 10
  - `Email` should be valid email
  - `Status` should be "Active", "Done", or "Rejected"
- Transform
  - `PublishDate` to be DateTime
  - `Contact` to be Contact.Title value from API

Below is the result type from the parse operation:
![Result](assets/result.png)

When it's failed to parse (wrong type or not pass validation), it will throw error.
In this example I just simple render error message when it happens.
![Failed parse](assets/failed-parse.png)

In this example, I used the parsed result data to be displayed on a [DetailsList](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/detailslist) component
