## Summary

The React-PPP-PnP-Controls sample showcases the use of the [Property Pane Portal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/property-pane-portal) to display the [PnP SPFx React controls](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-controls-react) (version 3.7.0) in the SPFx Property Pane.

> We are NOT using the [SPFx Property Controls](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-property-controls), that's the point of the sample.

## Features

This sample showcases the use of the **Property Pane Portal** NPM module. It allows us to use PnP SPFx React controls in the Property Pane, without the need to build custom property controls.

The Property Pane Portal module includes:

* The PropertyPaneHost function, which creates placeholders in the Property Pane
* The PropertyPanePortal component, which leverages React Portals to teleport React components to the Property Pane.

Implemented controls:

* Location Picker
* People Picker
* List Picker and List Item Picker (cascading selection)

## Known Issues

There are a couple minor issues with the Location Picker of the SPFx React Controls library. [I am working with the authors](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/issues/1125) to get them addressed in the next release. In the meantime, be aware that:

* the control will overflow its container width if the address is too long
* the control doesn't work on the root site
