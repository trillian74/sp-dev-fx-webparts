## Prerequisites

The SPFx App has thisPrerequisites:

* Azure Function Deployed to Azure 

   In the directory **./OpenAIFunctionProject/OpenAI-azure-functions.zip**  you will found the project with AzureFunction zip.ed, please copy to local computer unzip and deploy. The Azure Function App needs to be configured with Authentication Provider Microsoft , please see the README.md file on the project.

* OpenAI KEY

   The App require your personal API_KEY to call the API to ChatGPT. Please go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an Account and get your API KEY.
   This API KY needs to be configured on the Azure Function App in Applications Settings. See README.md on Azure Functions Project for more details.

* Configure Tenant Properties.

    The App needs the follow tenant properties configured on your tenant :

  * "OpenAIFunctionsAppId" this Tenant property has the Azure APPID used to secure your Azure Function APP (see README.md on OpenAIFunctionProject)

      To add Tenant property you can use M365 Cli or PowerShell to do it.

      sample M365 Cli  :

        ``m365 spo storageentity set --key OpenAIFunctionsAppId --value  6b4a20b2-bf2f-xxxx-xxxx-af960a40c2dc  --appCatalogUrl https://xxxxx.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog``

      sample PnP-PowerShell:

        ``Set-PnPStorageEntity -Key OpenAIFunctionsAppId -Value 6b4a20b2-bf2f-xxxx-xxxx-af960a40c2dc``

  * "OpenAIAzureFunctionUrl", this Tenant property has the URL of Azure Function

      sample M365 Cli  :

        ``m365 spo storageentity set --key OpenAIAzureFunctionUrl --value  https://openaifunctionsapp.azurewebsites.net/api/OpenAICompletion  --appCatalogUrl https://xxxxx.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog``

      sample PnP-PowerShell:

         ``Set-PnPStorageEntity -Key OpenAIAzureFunctionUrl -Value  https://openaifunctionsapp.azurewebsites.net/api/OpenAICompletion``


    * Upload APP to Teams catalog

      This App can be used has Teams Message Extension, please go to "teams" directory and upload the zip file to Teams App on M365 Teams Administration.



  * Approve the Required App Permissions on SharePoint Admin.

    You need to add the required permissions to the App for your Azure App used to secure the Azure Function App, by default the project has the follow defined on the package-solution.json:

    ``"webApiPermissionRequests": [
      {
        "resource": "OpenAIFunctionsApp",
        "scope": "user_impersonation"
      }
    ],``

This assume you have a Azure App called "OpenAIFunctionsApp", you can change this before bundle and create the package to deploy and after you Azure Functions App configured. <https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps>
