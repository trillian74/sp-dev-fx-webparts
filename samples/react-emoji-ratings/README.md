## Summary

This is sample web part which can be used to take emoji based reaction or feedback for particular news/article/posts.
We all know every organizations would be using SharePoint news features for company's internal communications from HR to IT updates and some time annoucements. News created in SharePoint are created as Pages in library. Idea behind this web part is to take employee/user's feedback as emoji reactions on particular news. This web part can also be used on wiki articles or blog posts to take similar reactions. Web part uses concept of 1 to 5 star based rating system(configurable), you can decide low to high based on your preference.

Ideally, we can do some automation using PnP Powershell and PowerAutomate (trigger when item is created ) to add this web part to any every news that is published.

If you wish to directly use the package in your tenant here is [link](https://github.com/siddharth-vaghasia/public-docs/blob/master/react-emoji-reaction-rating.sppkg) to download.

## Features

* Configurable header text, rating text, and images
* We can choose to show from minimum one rating to max 5 rating images and text
* Option to show total count of particular rating count as badge
* Option to show and capture comments from user when submitting feedback
* Display current user's rating selection with highlighted background
* Allow user to change rating(update rating)
* Stores ratings in SharePoint List
* Option to create list on the fly and choose list to store the ratings
* Option for admin to choose background color

## Technical Notes

* User's rating data would be stored in SP List, below are list of columns and its relevance

1. `Title`: To store user's display name (not required though)
2. `Page Name`: To store page on which rating is given by particular user, this will have absolute URL of page
3. `User`: To store user who has given feedback for particular page/news where web part is added
4. `Comment`: To store comment provided by user while submitting reaction.
5. Then there are 5 columns `Rating1`, `Rating2`, `Rating3`, `Rating4`, `Rating5` which will store the rating text configured by admin in web part... Only one of this 5 columns would be populated for single item in list, which is what user has selected as part of giving reaction

* Below is how you can configure emoji's text and its image URL

I have added default emoji's images which can be used and uploaded to SharePoint library in the assets folder of this solution.
