## Features

This sample is a complete app that demonstrates the "SPFx Solution Accelerator" framework, along with patterns and practices for building enterprise-class apps on SharePoint.  Inspired by Domain Driven Design and Onion Architecture, this accelerator has evolved since SPFx v1.0, and we want to share it with the world!

At a high-level, the accelerator includes the following features:
* Prescribed [solution structure](./documentation/solution-structure.md) separates web parts, components, model, services, and schema (data) layers
* Robust [entity domain model](./documentation/entities.md) with relationships, validation, change tracking, and text search
* Robust [schema provisioning](./documentation/schema.md) and versioning; use SharePoint lists as a simple relational database
* [Services](./documentation/services.md) for interacting with SharePoint, timezones, domain isolation, and users and groups, plus patterns for building custom services for app-specific logic
* [Component library](./documentation/components.md) with customizable wizard, panel/dialog for quickly building view/edit screens, validation, and more
* [Live Update](./documentation/live-update.md) feature ensures users are always working with the latest data without manaually reloading the page
* Built on the latest SPFx with TypeScript, React, and Fluent UI, plus PnPjs, Moment.js, Lodash, and Jest

A deep dive into the various features of the accelerator can be found in the [documentation](./documentation/README.md) folder.
