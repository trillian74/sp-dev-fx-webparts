# Facebook Page Social Plugin

## Summary

This sample shows how to implement iFrame-based web parts with a dynamic responsive behavior on the example of Facebook Page Social Plugin.

The key differences between using Embed web part and current example are the strong parametrization of web part properties and responsive behavior of the iFrame depending on parent container width changes.
