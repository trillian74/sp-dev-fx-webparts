# Cherry picked content

## Summary

The Cherry-Picked Content Web Part is a modern replacement for the classic Content Editor Web Part, with a twist: code snippets can only be picked from approved document libraries.

## Prerequisites

Start by editing the `ApprovedLibraries.ts` file to list your approved libraries. Then upload your code snippets to those locations. If you are looking for ideas, check out the samples folder.

The code can be rendered in two ways:

- isolated: the code is wrapped in an `iframe` to prevent conflicts with other Web Parts. Note: this is not a security feature.
- non isolated: the code is directly inserted in the page.
