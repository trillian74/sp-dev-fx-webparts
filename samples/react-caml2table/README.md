## Prerequisites

This is a tool designed to help people who already know CAML to get going faster, not to help you build queries.

I highly recommend checking out [the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/schema/collaborative-application-markup-language-caml-schemas) for more info


## Minimal path to awesome

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/react-caml2table) then unzip it)
* From your command line, change your current directory to the directory containing this sample (`react-caml2table`, located under `samples`)
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`

> This sample can also be opened with [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Visit <https://aka.ms/spfx-devcontainer> for further instructions.

## Features

This is a simple Web part that allows the user to input a [CAML Query](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/schema/collaborative-application-markup-language-caml-schemas), select a list and run the query.

I've been using PnP PowerShell to do this for a while, when you need to test a query real quick, but PowerShell can be dreading to some users, and is a whole new tool to learn, so in order to best help people whom are learning I made this __VERY__ simple Web part.

It also demonstrates several useful skill that a new SPFx Developer might find handy

- PnPJs - To make the request.
- @pnp/spfx-controls-react - Are used both as the ListView and the ListPicker.
- React functional components which are yet to be the default in SPFx.
- React Context to avoid passing things that are needed globally as props.
