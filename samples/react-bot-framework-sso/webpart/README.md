## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository

- Edit `BotSignInToast.tsx` file to set your AAD scope uri(`scopeUri`) with `api://YOUR_APP_ID` directly like `api://123a45b6-789c-01de-f23g-h4ij5k67a8bc`:

    ```ts
    return tokenProvider.getToken(scopeUri, true).then((token: string) => {
    ```

- Add the following config to ./config/package-solution.json:

    ```diff
        "webApiPermissionRequests": [
    +     {
    +       "resource": "<YOUR_APP_ID>",
    +       "scope": "<YOUR_AAD_SCOPE_NAME>"
    +     }
        ],
    ```

- Refer [Connect to Azure AD-secured APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aadhttpclient) to publish and approve permissions from admin site

- In the command line run

    ```bash
    cd ../extension
    npm install
    gulp serve
    ```

- Open online test page with user account: https://<YOUR_SITE>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/Workbench.aspx
