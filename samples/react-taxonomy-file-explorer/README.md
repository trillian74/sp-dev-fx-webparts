## Summary

This solution renders a given Termset as a Tree and incorporates files similar than a folder structure in file explorer. Benefit: Due to multiple selection in the managed metadata column the same file can occur more than once.
Additionally with drag and drop options the file can be changed:
- By replacing the managed metadata column with the target term (Move)
- By adding the target term to the managed metadata column (Link)
- By copying the file to a new one with (only) the target term in the managed metadata column (Copy)

In action this looks like:

[UPDATE] Collapse and expand all:
